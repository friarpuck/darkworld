The tension could not have been any thicker as Senshain stepped into the room.  Her leather boots made no sound even though she made no effort to silence her steps as she walked across the stone floor of the room.  Mike found himself unintentionally holding his breath as she passed Alana and executed a smart turn to face her.  Alana closed the door behind Senshain and stood facing her former friend.

Mike felt out of place, as though he were intruding upon a showdown that had been years in the making.  But Alana had been insistent that he be there.  And Senshain gave no indication that she even noticed him in the room or, if she did, that she cared he was there.  He did his best to blend in with the wall, hoping that, if he acted like a piece of furniture, perhaps he wouuld only be regarded as such.  

He tried to read Alana's face, hoping to glean some indication of her intentions for this meeting. He knew that it was possible that he would have to intervene at some point. The political situation being what it was, Alana's nerves were already on the bring of fraying and Senshain was difficult to contain on even her best of days.  If things were to turn physical, Mike would be useless.  His own Dark power was extremely limited and no match for Alana's Dark or Light.  And he had nowhere near the reflexes, strength or fighting experience of Senshain.  If the two were determined to fight this out, he would be useless.

Alana knew this, so why did she want him here?
